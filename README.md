Creating a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code; using my HTML, CSS, jQuery, and JavaScript skills.

I initallty had a hard time stlying the tables, and getting them to match up with the demo in the read me. Once I figured out to use table and got them styled similar to the demo. I then added the current day using moment and added it to a p tag. Then I wrote a 4 loop to change and set the colors based on the time of day, and weather or not it was past the current hour.
